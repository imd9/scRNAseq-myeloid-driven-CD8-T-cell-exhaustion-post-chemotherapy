"Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis: Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, and Trajectory Inference of myeloid-driven CD8+ T cell exhaustion post-chemotherapy"
This project aims to investigates myeloid-driven CD8+ T cell exhaustion post-chemotherapy using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics. By leveraging dimensionality reduction, clustering, and trajectory inference, we want to uncover dynamic immune microenvironments and elucidate myeloid-T cell interactions shaping CD8+ T cell dysfunction. Our findings should highlight the spatiotemporal plasticity of immune cell states, providing insights into the mechanisms of T cell exhaustion and potential therapeutic targets in the post-chemotherapy setting.

Due to system memory limitations and time constraints, I was unable to complete the remaining tasks within the expected deadline and quality standards. I explored various methods to address the memory issues and optimize file sizes for improved plot rendering; however, despite my efforts, I was not successful in resolving these challenges within the given timeframe. As a result, I was unable to continue drawing observations and conducting further analysis for the remainder of the project.

I will revist this case study for completion once memory upgrades have been made.
